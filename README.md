About the Dataset:
This data is about a fictional company, Cyclistic.
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.
Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Director of marketing and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
